WARNING [240]    SGDC file '../script/Spyglass.sgdc' contains both Waiver and other SGDC constraints.
                 It is recommended to define Waiver and other SGDC constraints in
                 separate files because use-model for Waiver and other SGDC
                 constraints are different. Please also note, waiver files are specified
                 using 'waiver' option.
